# bash-commands
A C program that reads basic Bash commands and prints out the result of said
commands.
The program implements file and directory manipulation commands such as touch,
mkdir, ls, rm, rmdir, cd, pwd, tree and mv, but with very basic functionality.
For testing, I have been given a checker made in Python. To run it, use
make checker.
